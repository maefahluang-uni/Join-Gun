# JoinGun — Product Backlog

Transcribed from the [original backlog](<../../เอกสาร/JoinGun Backlog.md.pdf>), preserving task IDs, task names, priorities, story points, and statuses. All assignee fields in the source are blank.

The Trace column maps items to the [Requirement Spec](01-spec/20260908-01-joingun.md) and [rule.md](../../rule.md). These mappings document identified sources, not a completed audit: the supplied files contain no interview evidence log or Pain IDs.

## Development Priorities and Outstanding Review Items

- Selected core workflow: **Join an activity from the feed**, referencing 2.2–2.4 and 7.1–7.2. Prerequisites include verified accounts, available activities, and meeting locations, with consent and logging as required by the project rules.
- Use the Spec's MoSCoW priorities for development sequencing: F1–F3 are Must, F4–F5 are Should, F6 is Could, and F7 is Won't. High/Medium values in the table are preserved from the PDF and have not yet been reconciled with the Spec.
- Before submission, add evidence-based user stories and requirement IDs for joining/leaving and items currently linked only to the Scope or Proposal. Do not treat F3 as a complete specification of joining/leaving behavior.
- Link every item to a Pain ID from an actual evidence log and add measurable acceptance criteria. The source PDF lists task names but does not provide full user stories or acceptance criteria.
- Review coverage of system-level NFR4 and the details of F5/LR2 in items 7.3 and 8.2. Adding a trace reference alone does not establish compliance or a passed audit.
- See [Legal traceability](01-spec/20260908-02-legal-traceability.md) for outstanding compliance gaps.
- The 22 items total **117 points (High 93, Medium 24)**, whereas the PDF summary states 113 points (High 92, Medium 21). This version preserves the original row values; the team must confirm whether individual rows or the summary need correction before submission.
